## General shape
### Parts of the ship
Hull: Main part of the ship that interacts with the water  
Bow: Front of the ship  
Aft: Back of the ship  

### Lines
**Main lines planes**:  
℄ = Centerline plane: Line along the symmetrical axis of the ship.  
)O( = Midship plane: Defined middle of the ship. Usually where the ship is the widest.  
Design waterline plane: Theoretical water line.  
Keel line: Line at the bottom of the ship.

**Shape lines**:  
Line drawings: Ship plan that shows the shape of the ship  
Waterlines:  
Stations:  
Buttocks:  

### Dimensions
LOA = Lenght Overall: Geometrical length of the ship.  
L<sub>WL</sub> = Lenght on the waterline:  
FP = Forward perpendicular: Custom point at the front of the ship.  
AP = Aft perpendicular: Custom point at the back of the ship.  

B = Beam: Geometrical width of the ship.  
B<sub>WL</sub> = Beam at the water line = Maximum width at the water line.  

D = Depth: Height of the hull  
T = Draft: Distance between the keel line and the design water line.  
Freeboard: Calculated by `Depth - Draft`

## Analysis
### General ratios
L/B = Length to beam: Describes how narrow the ship is.  
L/D = Length do depth: Describes how tall the ship is length wise.  
B/D = Beam do depth: Describes how tall the ship is width wise.  
B/T = Beam to draft: Describes how shallow the ship is.  

A<sub>W</sub> = Waterplane area: Area of the horizontal slize of the hull at the design water line.  
C<sub>W</sub> = Waterplane coefficient: A<sub>W</sub> / (B<sub>WL</sub> * L<sub>WL</sub>) = Describes how full the waterplane is.  

CF = Center of flotation: =Center of the waterplane area. Point about which the ship rotates.  
Trim axis: Axis normal to the Centerline plane, passing through the Center of flotation.  
LCF = Longitudinal center of floation: Distance between the Trim axis and usually the Midship plane. Sometimes to the forward or aft perpendicular.  
I<sub>L</sub> = Longitudinal moment of inertia: Second moment of inertia about the Trim axis. (pitch)  
I<sub>T</sub> = Transverse moment of inertia: Second moment of inertia around the roll axis. (roll)  

### Underwater
∇ = Volume of displacement: Volume of the hull under water.  
B = Center of buoyancy: Center of the volume of displacement.
